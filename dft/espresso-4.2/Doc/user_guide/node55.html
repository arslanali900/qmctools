11.2 Installation</A>
</H2>

<P>
Most installation problems have obvious origins and can be solved by reading
error messages and acting accordingly. Sometimes the reason for a failure
is less obvious. In such a case, you should look into 
Sec.<A HREF="node9.html#Sec:Installation">2.2</A>, and into the <TT>pw_forum</TT> archive to
see if a similar problem (with solution) is described. If you get
really weird error messages during installation, look for them with
your preferred Internet search engine (such as Google): very often you
will find an explanation and a workaround. 

<P>

11.2.0.1 What Fortran compiler do I need to compile Q<SMALL>UANTUM </SMALL>ESPRESSO?</A>
</H4>

<P>
Any non-buggy, or not-too-buggy, fortran-95 compiler should work,
with minimal or no changes to the code. <TT>configure</TT>may not 
be able to recognize your system, though.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION000122020000000000000">
11.2.0.2 Why is <TT>configure</TT> saying that I have no fortran compiler?</A>
</H4>

<P>
Because you haven't one (really!); or maybe you have one, but it is not
in your execution path; or maybe it has been given an unusual name by your 
system manager. Install a compiler if you have none; if you have one, fix 
your execution path, or define an alias if it has a strange name.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION000122030000000000000">
11.2.0.3 Why is <TT>configure</TT> saying that my fortran compiler doesn't work?</A>
</H4>

<P>
Because it doesn't work (really!); more exactly, <TT>configure</TT> has tried 
to compile a small test program and didn't succeed. Your compiler may not be 
properly installed. For Intel compiler on PC's: you may have forgotten to run 
the required initialization script for the compiler.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION000122040000000000000">
11.2.0.4 <TT>configure</TT> doesn't recognize my system, what should I do?</A>
</H4>

<P>
If compilation/linking works, never mind, Otherwise, try to supply a suitable  
supported architecture, or/and manually edit the <TT>make.sys</TT> file. 
Detailed instructions in Sec.<A HREF="node9.html#Sec:Installation">2.2</A>.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION000122050000000000000">
11.2.0.5 Why doesn't <TT>configure</TT> recognize that I have a parallel machine?</A>
</H4>

<P>
You need a properly configured complete parallel environment. If any piece 
is missing, <TT>configure</TT> will revert to serial compilation. 
Detailed instructions in Sec.<A HREF="node9.html#Sec:Installation">2.2</A>.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION000122060000000000000">
11.2.0.6 Compilation fails with <EM>internal error</EM>, what should I do?</A>
</H4>

<P>
Any message during compilation saying something like <EM>internal compiler 
error</EM>
and the like means that your compiler is buggy. You should report the problem 
to the compiler maker - especially if you paid real money for it.
Sometimes reducing the optimization level, or rearranging the code in a
strategic place, will make the problem disappear. In other cases you 
will need to move to a different compiler, or to a less buggy version
(or buggy in a different way that doesn't bug you) of the same compiler.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION000122070000000000000">
11.2.0.7 Compilation fails at linking stage: <EM>symbol ... not found</EM></A>
</H4>
If the missing symbols (i.e. routines that are called but not found)
are in the code itself: most likely the fortran-to-C conventions used
in file <TT>include/c_defs.h</TT> are not appropriate. Edit this file
and retry.

<P>
If the missing symbols are in external libraries (Blas, Lapack, FFT,
MPI libraries): 
there is a name mismatch between what the compiler expects and what the
library provides. See Sec.<A HREF="node9.html#Sec:Installation">2.2</A>).

<P>
If the missing symbols aren't found anywhere either in the code or in the
libraries: they are system library symbols. i) If they are called by external 
libraries, you need to add a missing system library, or to use a different 
set of external libraries, compiled with the same compiler you are using. 
ii) If you are using no external libraries and still getting missing symbols, 
your compiler and compiler libraries are not correctly installed.
